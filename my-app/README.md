# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up Google Cloud Vision API Key

   The app uses Google Cloud Vision API for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract meter readings from images. To enable this feature:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `my-app` directory (if it doesn't exist)
   - Add your Google Cloud Vision API key:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep your API key secure
   - Restart your Expo development server after adding the environment variable

   **Note:** You can get a Google Cloud Vision API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure the Cloud Vision API is enabled for your project.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
